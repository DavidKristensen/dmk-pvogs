			<h2>Welcome to the pVOGs Database</h2>
			<br><p><q><i>Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth and encompass a vast amount of genetic diversity. The recent rapid increase in the number of sequenced viral genomes has created unprecedented opportunities for gaining new insight into the structure and evolution of the virosphere.</i></q> Kristensen DM et al., 2013.</p>
			<p>This website provides access to the most recent database <span id="num">9,518</span> orthologous groups shared among nearly <span id="num">3,000</span> thousand complete genomes of viruses that infect bacteria and archaea (<span id="num">P</span>rokaryotic <span id="num">V</span>irus <span id="num">O</span>rthologous <span id="num">G</span>roups, or <span id="num">pVOGs</span>). The set of pVOGs keeps growing and may have a wide range of applications in different areas of life sciences including taxonomy, evolutionary genetics, genomic epidemiology, metagenomics, systems biology, ecology, among others.</p>
			<p>This webpage is a resource portal which provides access to the updated set of pVOGs, previously known as POGs (Phage Orthologous Groups):</p>
			<p>You will find information regarding all prokaryotic virus genomes used for this update in the following <a href="genometable.html"><span id="num">Genome Table</span></a>. General description of all pVOGs obtained for this update will be find at the <a href="VOGbigtable.html"><span id="num">VOG Table</span></a>. Accessions of genomes and proteins belonging to each identified pVOG may be found following the links present in both tables. The <a href="viralquotient.html"><span id="num">Viral Quotient</span></a> measurements have been added to the pVOGs database. The <a href="downloads.html"><span id="num">Downloads</span></a> page provides VOG alignments, HMM profiles and files of all VOG tables in tabular delimited format for downloading. The history of updates and new releases can be followed at <a href="updatesreleases.html"><span id="num">Updates & Releases</a> page. Statistics of database growth and publications can be viewed at <a href="statistics.html"><span id="num">Statistics</span></a> page. The <a href="tutorial.html"><span id="num">Tutorial</span></a> page describing how to navigate in this website is also provided.</p><br>

			<h3>Importance and Applications of pVOGs</h3>
			<br><p>&#10004 To understand the history of viral protein families</p>
			<p>&#10004 To aid in evolutionary classification of known phages</p>
			<p>&#10004 To be applied in the reconstruction of ancestral phage genomes</p>
			<p>&#10004 To help annotate orthologs from poorly characterized genomes</p>
			<p>&#10004 To identify virus-specific genes that could be used as diagnostic markers of prokaryotic viruses presence in a given environment</p>
			
			<p id="para2">For instance, using pVOGs in aforementioned research fields may improve the development of phage-based tools and our understanding on:</p>
			
			<p>&#10004 Phage therapy</p>
			<p>&#10004 Host genome dynamics</p>
			<p>&#10004 Bacterial pathogenesis</p>
			<p>&#10004 Important roles of phages in distinct ecosystems</p>
			
			<p id="para2">Have fun working with pVOGs!</p><br>
